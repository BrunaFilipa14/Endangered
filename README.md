# Endangered
Endangered is a website that provides information about endangered species and organizations that help reduce the effects of human activity.
It was created as a submition for a first year class called "Introduction to Web Programming" from the CTeSP in "Information System's Technologies and Programming" lectured at IPS.

**To run the website open the files in Visual Studio Code, right click on the index.html file and click "Open with Live Server". 
*You can now explore it! :)
